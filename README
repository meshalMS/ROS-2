we need doenload ROS in jetson nano:

First download version xubuntu 20.04 L4T R32.3.1 from next link:

https://github.com/Discombobulated88/Xubuntu-20.04-L4T-32.3.1/releases

By etcher program and with xubuntu 20.04 L4T R32.3.1 system we do (Flash image) process on micro SD card.

And if jetson nano Version A02 we just get in SD card on jetson nano after that a screen will appear installization screen and we complete insatall normally

While if the version B01 we open file on SD card by name (extlinux.conf) and open it by terminal and tybe the next command:

 Sudo vim extlinux.conf 
And add this next line:

 boot/tecira210-p3448-0000-p3449-0000-b00.dtb
after that save the file and we just get in SD card on jetson nano after that a screen will appear initialization screen and we complete insatall normally.

But as for ROS we just paste the commands from Foxy Fitzroy on terminal the commands is in the next link:
